<p>In a journey to expand human knowledge, we struggle to extract
meaningful information from the torrent of the data that our world is
flooded with. Once upon a time, the clever plotting method was the
only thing needed to solve the cholera problem and prevent countless
life losses (I guess that John Snow *did* know something). Even though
less dramatic, the impact of visual representation of the data is
still pretty considerable, since even if the analysis is done by fancy
statistical methods and deep learning techniques, the decisions are
usually made according to easy-to-digest plots and one-number
summaries. This post is my list of plots that I reach for the most.
Plots that in my opinion and for my purposes were able to effectively
tell a story. Simple enough that can be understood by the
non-technical audience (managers and salespeople) and beautiful enough
to be presented to clients.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">The Iris almighty</h2>

<p>For example,  we can plot ALL information from Fisher's famous Iris
data set on one plot (I know, Iris *again*, but bear with me. That's
the one we are all familiar with) by fusion between a bubble and
scatter plot.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
